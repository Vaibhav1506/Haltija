disadvantage 1
management complexity and effort - manage that shit

2nd
sudden shift from monocropping to crop rotation - reduced yield
gather cropping history and suggest depending on that . if a farmer has already tried crop rotation before and still doesn't get desired results. that will be a different category. and a farmer with sole monocropping will have different suggestions

3rd
crop rotation
lack of knowledge. crop changes pest changes. which can be unknown to farmer. alert beforehand and suggest pesticide and blah blah stuff

-record every years profits and yields.
