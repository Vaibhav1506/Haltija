C₃ Plants (e.g., rice, wheat): Tend to contribute more to carbon footprints due to their lower efficiency, higher water and fertilizer needs, and methane emissions (in cases like rice).
C₄ Plants (e.g., maize, sugarcane): Generally have a lower carbon footprint due to their efficiency in photosynthesis, lower input requirements, and higher adaptability to adverse conditions.
In terms of global agricultural sustainability, improving the efficiency of C₃ plant farming or shifting to more sustainable practices with C₄ crops can help reduce overall carbon footprints.

C₃ Plants:
Often require larger areas to achieve the same productivity as C₄ plants, which leads to more land-clearing and deforestation, contributing to carbon emissions.
C₄ Plants:
More productive per unit area in challenging climates, reducing the need for land conversion.

disadvantage 1
management complexity and effort - manage that shit

2nd
sudden shift from monocropping to crop rotation - reduced yield
gather cropping history and suggest depending on that . if a farmer has already tried crop rotation before and still doesn't get desired results. that will be a different category. and a farmer with sole monocropping will have different suggestions

3rd
crop rotation
lack of knowledge. crop changes pest changes. which can be unknown to farmer. alert beforehand and suggest pesticide and blah blah stuff

-record/track every years profits and yields.

-show recently published good farming articles/podcasts for knowledge/awareness and stay upto date with modern and sustainable farming practices (since many indian farmers still depend on old methods).

-chatting/frnd (tinder ?) group of farmers (social well being - sustainable)..

govt schemes\loans\NGO. dont go to moneylenders.
